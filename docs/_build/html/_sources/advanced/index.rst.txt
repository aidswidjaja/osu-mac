.. warning::

    This section is meant for developers, not for end users. If you're trying to get osu! running on macOS, see `Common issues <../issues/index.html>`_ instead.

Advanced debugging is for those who are interested in the root causes of issues facing the underlying technology which osu! on macOS relies on.  Much of this section's documentation digs deep into Wineskin, graphics, system APIs and mid to low-level programming.

Although much of this information was produced with osu! in mind, the information here should be useful to anyone interested in exploring WINE, low-level graphics and other areas of the system that is required for debugging cross-platform compatibility layers.
