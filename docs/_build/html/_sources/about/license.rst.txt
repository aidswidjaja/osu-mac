Report alleged copyright infringement
=====================================

It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov) and other applicable intellectual property laws. Our response may include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers.

Infringement Notification
=========================

To file a notice of infringement with us, **please send an email** to `nstyvm@gmail.com <mailto:nstyvm@gmailcom?DMCA>`_.

IMPORTANT: Misrepresentations made in your notice regarding whether material or activity is infringing may expose you to liability for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees). Courts have found that you must consider copyright defenses, limitations or exceptions before sending a notice. In one case involving online content, a company paid more than $100,000 in costs and attorneys fees after targeting content protected by the U.S. fair use doctrine. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.

Given that these repositories are unlicensed, it is presumed that the authors reserve all rights, however since it is hosted on GitHub we hope it's alright that we've included it here for educational purposes. Failing that, the `Copyright Act 1968 (Cwth.) <https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019C00042>`_ provides for the reproduction of content for purpose of research and study under fair dealing. 

Under Part III, Division 3, s40:

.. code-block::

    A fair dealing with a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work,
    or with an adaptation of a literary, dramatic or musical work, for
    the purpose of research or study does not constitute an infringement
    of the copyright in the work.

where under Part III, Division 4A, s47AB:

.. code-block::

    computer program includes any literary work that is:

        (a)  incorporated in, or associated with, a computer program; and
        (b)  essential to the effective operation of a function of that
             computer program.

As you can see, I've been doing Legal Studies at school, except we're doing employment law.
