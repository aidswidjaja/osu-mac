This article is designed to give you the basics in troubleshooting osu!mac issues. It contains information on how to generate a report, troubleshooting techniques specific to Wine, and tips for communicating with other people in the osu!mac community.

****

********************************************
Accessing the insides of your Wineskin
********************************************

Generally speaking, you can access the Package Contents of your Wineskin by right clicking on ``osu!.app`` and selecting **Show Package Contents**. 

Three items should now appear:

- **Contents** is a directory that Wineskin uses to store all its files - generally you won't need to access this folder for troubleshooting
- **drive_c_** is an alias (shortcut) that represents a Windows filesystem which Wine imitates
- **Wineskin** is the program you use to manage, edit, and troubleshoot your Wineskin

****

********************************************
Locating osu! crash logs
********************************************

Just like on Windows, osu! will generate it's own crash logs that can be useful for troubleshooting.

If a dialog like the one below appears:

.. image:: ../assets/osu-crash.png
    :alt: osu! has crashed.

Click on the window. You should be able to view the crash logs now:

.. image:: ../assets/osu-crash-log.png
    :alt: osu! crash log.

You can also find more logs under the Logs folder in your ``drive_c`` directory. To do this:

1. Locate where ``osu!.app`` is installed
2. Right click on it and select **Show Package Contents**
3. You should now see three files/folders: ``Contents``, ``drive_c`` and ``Wineskin``. Click ``drive_c``
4. Then, click ``osu!``
5. Select ``Logs``

Your log files should be present here.

********************************************
Generating a report with osu!macOS Agent
********************************************

To generate a report with `Technocoder <https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10338558>`_'s osu!macOS Agent:

1. Open osu!macOS Agent (duh)
2. Click the **Troubleshoot** report
3. Click **Scan**
4. Upon completion of the scan, click **Copy Report**

    - Save this to a text file or someplace where you won't forget

.. tip::

    osu!macOS Agent is a useful program every osu-stable player under Wine should have!

****

********************************************
Generating logs for Wineskin
********************************************

If your Wineskin isn't starting or working properly, you can try diagnosing the issue with a Test Run of your Wineskin, that will produce logs that will describe any problems in detail.

To generate a Wineskin log:

1. Open the Wineskin program by following `these instructions <#accessing-the-insides-of-your-wineskin>`_
2. Click the **Advanced** tab
3. Click the **Test Run** button

.. image:: ../assets/wineskin-test-run.png

4. If osu! starts, you can close the program immediately (unless you need to test an issue that occurs at a particular moment in time, like when editing beatmaps)
5. A window like the one below will appear. Click **Yes**

.. image:: ../assets/wineskin-test-run-success.png

Two plain-text files will appear. One contains information about your system and Wineskin, while the other provides a log of errors, warnings and events that were recorded while your Wineskin was operating. 

Save both of these to a text file or someplace where you won't forget.

********************************************
Communicating your issues with other people
********************************************

We want to help you get osu! running on your macOS-powered device, so to make the process as easy as possible for everyone involved, it's important to be clear and concise right from the get-go.

**Please do:**

- See the `Common issues <index.html>`_ section to see if there's a fix you can try
- Describe your issue in lots and lots of detail

    - You can make a distinction between expected behaviour (what you think is supposed to happen) and actual behaviour (what actually ends up happening) in your issue report

- Provide information on when/why your issue happens (if you know)
- Provide information about your computer specs and the wrapper you used
- Attach screenshots and log files (from both `osu!macOS Agent <#generating-a-report-with-osu-macos-agent>`_ and `Wineskin <#generating-logs-for-wineskin>`_
- Tell us what you've already tried to do

The best place to report issues is on the `osu! forums <https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/5>`_ - make sure you put **macOS** in the title of your post (so other people know ofc).
