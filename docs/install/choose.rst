Which Wineskin should I get?

    **What is a Wineskin?**

    A Wineskin is a wrapper that bundles the compatibility layer `Wine <https://www.winehq.org/>`_ with Windows executables like osu!, to enable them to run on POSIX/Unix-based operating systems like macOS and Linux.

There's a bunch of community-maintained osu! Wineskins out there, and osu!mac documents three of them.

- `Technocoder's osu! Wineskin with support for Apple Silicon running under Rosetta 2 <install/rosetta.html>`_ 
- `Technocoder's osu! Wineskin with support for macOS Catalina 10.15 and later <install/10-15.html>`_ 
- `slc's osu! Wineskin for macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier <install/10-14.html>`_

There's also...

- `peppy's official osu! Wineskin (2016) <https://github.com/ppy/osu-wine>`_
- `Mic238's osu! for Mac Wineskin <https://github.com/Mic238/osu-for-Mac-Stable-Latest>`_

However, we don't provide support for these Wineskins.

For most users, we recommend using the latest Wineskin, which is **Technocoder's osu! Wineskin with support for Apple Silicon running under Rosetta 2**. It is the only Wineskin that will consistently get updates and support, and has support for almost any modern Mac computer, including:

- Intel x86 based machines
- ARM-based Apple Silicon machines, including the new M1 chip
- Any modern version of macOS, including Mojave, Catalina, and Big Sur

You should only use other Wineskins if you need them for compatibility reasons. They will be outdated and support may be limited than one of the currently-maintained wrappers.
