Report alleged copyright infringement
=====================================

It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov) and other applicable intellectual property laws. Our response may include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers.

Infringement Notification
=========================

To file a notice of infringement with us, **please send an email** to `takedowns@adrian.id.au <mailto:takedowns@adrian.id.au?DMCA>`_.

IMPORTANT: Misrepresentations made in your notice regarding whether material or activity is infringing may expose you to liability for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees). Courts have found that you must consider copyright defenses, limitations or exceptions before sending a notice. In one case involving online content, a company paid more than $100,000 in costs and attorneys fees after targeting content protected by the U.S. fair use doctrine. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
