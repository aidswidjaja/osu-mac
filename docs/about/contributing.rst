Thank you for your interest in contributing to osu!mac!

osu!mac uses the Sphinx documentation generator, and files are marked up using `reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_. We refer to the `Python documentation style guide <https://devguide.python.org/documenting/>`_ loosely to keep our docs consistent. Docs are hosted on `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org>`_.

.. note::

     If you’re interested in contributing to osu!mac's documentation, there’s no need to write reStructuredText if you’re not so inclined; plain text contributions are more than welcome as well. Please open an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/aidswidjaja/osu-mac/issues>`_.

Most chatter related to osu!mac should be done by `opening an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/aidswidjaja/osu-mac/issues>`_ - forums are not monitored. You can also use the contact details provided `here <contact.html>`_.

Pull requests are welcome at any time, but it's probably a good idea to make an issue before getting started on it (I might already be working on it!).

.. note::

     When contributing, please ensure to run ``make html`` and build the site so that I can work locally as well.

Translations are very welcome but you'll need to open an issue on GitHub since I have to prepare the docs first on the technical side of things before getting started.

Thank you for helping out!

    See `this webpage <https://devguide.python.org/documenting/#sections>`_ for informaton about section headings in reStructuredText.
