Currently, osu!mac is being maintained by me, and mostly just me:

    GitHub:  https://github.com/aidswidjaja
    Discord: aidswidjaja#2805
    osu!:    https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17763202 (or https://old.ppy.sh/u/aidswidjaja)
    Email:   nstyvm at gmail dot com

If you need to contact me, it is **preferred** that you contact me by opening an issue on our GitHub repository: `aidswidjaja/osu-mac <https://github.com/aidswidjaja/osu-mac/issues>`_. When opening an issue related to an enquiry, be sure to tag it with the Question label so I know that you're asking a question, of course :D

I don't really monitor the forums too much so this is the best way to get in contact with me - but if any question relating to this pops up there in the off-chance that I am there I'll do my best to respond.

If you aren't able to open an issue on GitHub, or you need to discuss something in private, you can message me on osu! or DM me on Discord.

Email should only be used for DMCA/Copyright/other legal requests.

    The osu!mac documentation project is **not** affiliated with ppy, osu!, or any of the community members who developed the wrappers, unless otherwise indicated.
