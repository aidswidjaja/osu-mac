Getting started
=======================================

These community-developed osu-stable `Wineskins <http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php>`_ are the best way to play osu! ranked on your Mac.

- `Get Technocoder's osu! Wineskin with support for macOS Catalina 10.15 and later <install/10-15.html>`_ 
- `Get slc's osu! Wineskin for macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier <install/10-14.html>`_

Not sure which version of macOS you're using? Check out this `Apple support article <https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201260>`_ to find out.

Other options
=======================================

If you prefer, other options are available, including the official (but abandoned) Wineskin from ppy, or other alternatives (that won't let you play ranked). These docs won't cover these options in great detail but they're pretty straightforward to get started with.

- `Use peppy's official Wineskin <https://github.com/ppy/osu-wine>`_
- `Try out osu!lazer, which is the upcoming major release to osu! that runs natively on macOS and Linux <https://github.com/ppy/osu>`_
- `Download opsu! - an unofficial osu! client that runs natively on macOS and Linux <https://itdelatrisu.github.io/opsu/>`_
