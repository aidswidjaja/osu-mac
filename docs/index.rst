Getting started
=======================================

Community-developed osu! `Wineskins <http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php>`_ are the best way to play osu-stable on your Mac.

- Install them using our `installation guide <install/choose.html>`_
- Get started with our `new users section <welcome/index.html>`_
- Find fixes to your issue using our `knowledge base <issues/index.html>`_

Need help?
=======================================

A small but dedicated volunteer support team is available. Visit us on the `macOS Wineskin thread <https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1106057>`_ or start your own thread in the `Help subforum <https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/5>`_. 

- Along with a detailed description of your issue, attach your log files from `Troubleshooting Basics <issues/troubleshooting.html>`_ in a never-expire pastebin such as `paste.gg <https://paste.gg>`_
- If creating a thread, put **macOS** and **Wineskin** in your thread title.
- Our commmunity support members are volunteers, ranging from osu! support team members to people helping out in their free time. A response may take upwards to a week, although generally you should receive one within a day or two.

Other options
=======================================

If you prefer, other options are available, including the official (but abandoned) Wineskin from ppy, or other alternatives (that won't let you play ranked). These docs won't cover these options in great detail but they're pretty straightforward to get started with.

- `Use peppy's official Wineskin <https://github.com/ppy/osu-wine>`_
- `Try out osu!lazer, which is the upcoming major release to osu! that runs natively on macOS and Linux <https://github.com/ppy/osu>`_
- `Download opsu! - an unofficial osu! client that runs natively on macOS and Linux <https://itdelatrisu.github.io/opsu/>`_

Disclaimers
=======================================
