This is a replacement Wineskin.app executable for the osu! Wineskin at https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1106057 as uploaded by aidswidjaja (https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17763202) on 8 December 2020 AEDT.

Replace the Wineskin.app file inside your osu! wrapper with the one you downloaded here. It assumes default settings (so if you modified the Wineskin.app configuration beforehand, you'll need to do the same here)

*** STEPS TO INSTALL ****

    Inside osu!.app (Right click > Show Package Contents) locate Wineskin.app - make a backup of it (you can just rename it to say something like Wineskin.app.backup if you want)

    Replace the old Wineskin.app with the replacement version you just downloaded
